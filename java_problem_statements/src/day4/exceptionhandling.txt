Here is a clear and concise note on **Exception Handling in Java**:

## **Exception Handling in Java**

Exception handling in Java is a mechanism used to handle runtime errors, ensuring the normal flow of a program. Instead of the program terminating abruptly when an error occurs, Java allows the developer to catch and manage these errors gracefully.

### **1. What is an Exception?**

An **exception** is an event that occurs during program execution and disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
Examples: division by zero, invalid array index, null pointer access.

**Types of Exceptions:**

1. **Checked Exceptions** – Checked at compile time (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
2. **Unchecked Exceptions** – Occur at runtime (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException).
3. **Errors** – Serious issues not handled by programs (e.g., OutOfMemoryError).

### **2. Exception Handling Keywords**

Java uses five keywords for handling exceptions:

#### **try**

Block where exceptions are monitored.

```java
try {
   int a = 10 / 0;
}
```

#### **catch**

Block that handles the exception.

```java
catch (ArithmeticException e) {
   System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
}
```

#### **finally**

Block that always executes, whether an exception occurs or not.
Useful for closing resources (files, databases).

```java
finally {
   System.out.println("Cleanup code executed");
}
```

#### **throw**

Used to explicitly throw an exception.

```java
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
```

#### **throws**

Used in method declaration to indicate that the method may throw an exception.

```java
void myMethod() throws IOException {
   // code
}
```

### **3. Exception Handling Mechanism**

when an exception occurs:

1. The program stops executing the normal flow.
2. The exception object is created.
3. Java searches for a matching `catch` block.
4. If found → exception is handled.
   If not → program terminates with an error.

---

### **4. Multiple Catch Blocks**

A single `try` block can have multiple `catch` blocks.

```java
try {
   int arr[] = new int[5];
   arr[10] = 20;
}
catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
   System.out.println("Index error");
}
catch (Exception e) {
   System.out.println("General error");
}
```

### **5. Importance of Exception Handling**

* Prevents program crashes
* Improves error reporting
* Makes programs more robust
* Helps handle unexpected situations safely
